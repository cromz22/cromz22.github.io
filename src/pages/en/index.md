# Shuichiro Shimizu

I am a Ph.D. student at [Language Media lab](http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/), Kyoto University, Japan.
I received B.E. and M.S. from Kyoto University in 2021 and 2023, respectively.
I was a visiting scholar at [WAV lab](https://wavlab.org/), Carnegie Mellon University, USA in 2024.

I'm interested in cross-language communication technologies, with a focus on ambiguity that resides in communication through language.
My research encompasses speech translation, dialogue systems, multimodal machine translation / speech recognition.
