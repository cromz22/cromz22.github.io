This blog is a place to keep notes on my experiences, thoughts, and things I have looked into.
Even my own experiences can fade from memory, and at times I find it difficult to explain them clearly when others ask about them.

I'll write about whatever I am thinking about / working on at the time (sharing experiences, research notes, etc.).
Posts will be written irregularly.
I plan to prepare both English and Japanese versions (they may or may not be exact translations of each other).

The views expressed on this blog are my own and do not represent those of my affiliation.
